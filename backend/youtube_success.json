    "transcript": "Hello, this is motoki.This time, I tried the omakase course at Tokyo's very popular yakiniku restaurant \"YORONIKU TOKYO\", so I made a video of it.It 's very popular, so it's hard to make a reservation, but it's highly recommended, so be sure to go on your special day! YORONIKU TOKYO is a yakiniku restaurant located inside Azabudai Hills. I used to go to Ebisu YORONIKU, which is part of the same chain, but the staff who always grilled me was transferred to this store, so I came here . We started with an assortment of appetizers. There was an assortment of cucumber and Chinese cabbage kimchi, kakuteki, and namul. Normally, it would be eaten after the grilled meat, but I wanted to concentrate on the meat, so I ate everything first. The first sashimi that appeared was tomosankaku and fillet. Both are served with soy sauce. Tomosankaku is moderately fatty, but it is not greasy and refreshing. The lean fillet is very tender. It's fluffy and the refreshing taste of the wasabi and soy sauce goes perfectly with it.Next , the baguette comes.The baguette is then roasted on top of the roaster.Put the yukhoe on top to make it look like bruschetta. While the baguette was being grilled, the skirt steak came out.It takes a long time to grill, so we cook it at the same time as the other menu items.The staff at YORONIKU will grill everything, so you can enjoy the grilled meat with confidence.The baguette has changed color nicely.They will put this yukhoe on top of the baguette.The flavorful yukhoe mixed with egg yolk goes best with the buttery baguette. It's Taka.This restaurant has a lot of original menu items that you won't find anywhere else, so it's a lot of fun.It 's worth coming just for this yukhoe.◎ The next thing that comes out is the tongue.The thinly sliced ​​tongue is very beautiful.The skirt steak is also nicely browned.Actually , it's not done yet, but the meat is resting for a while.In this way, the meat is repeatedly grilled and rested, making use of the residual heat to thoroughly cook it. In the meantime , open the neatly wrapped tongue and let it cook quickly.This tongue is thin, so only one side is browned.By doing so, you can enjoy the aroma and juiciness at the same time.You don't have many chances to eat tongue that is cooked on only one side, so it's very fresh.This one is eaten with a little lemon.Depending on the day, the tongue roll can be thick and thick.This is a video from when I came here before. The thick tongue is a delicious tongue with a firm elasticity.Next came the shinshin and tsuchinoko.The tsuchinoko is the birthplace of YORONIKU.First , the shinshin is lightly cooked.Although it is lean meat, it is moist and tender and very delicious.It is served with plenty of sweet sauce.The skirt steak is seasoned and you can tell how soft it is.The salad comes out.The dressing is lemon-flavored and very refreshing. The salad that comes out at this time is nice to cleanse your palate.Tsuchinoko is characterized by its fluffy softness, so it is best eaten by folding it in two to make it thicker.Although this meat is lean meat with little fat, it is very tender.The color of the surface changes slightly.The staff are meat professionals, so the grilling method brings out the characteristics of the ingredients.Next , there is the thinly sliced ​​tongue. The kitchen staff has cut the tongue from the base to the middle of the tongue. It's so beautiful... This one is lightly cooked on both sides. An amateur wouldn't be able to cook such a thin tongue. 🙇‍♂️ This is topped with salted kelp. Salted kelp is also rare in yakiniku. Now, the slowly and carefully grilled skirt steak is finally done. I'm curious to see what's on the inside. It's a beautiful pink color! This is cut into bite-sized pieces for the number of people.This is served with salt and garlic chips.The meaty and juicy flavor of the skirt steak is the best.Next , the meat sushi comes.There is caviar on top.The meat sushi that eats with the salty taste of caviar is very delicious.The soup with chopsticks has hachinosu in it . The second half of the Omakase course Next came the meat with the sauce, the chateaubriand and the silk loin.First , we turned the heat to very low and cooked the chateaubriand.Just like the skirt steak, we took our time to cook this carefully.It is a delicate yakiniku that is the complete opposite of the yakiniku that is grilled over a fire and eaten with smoke. The flavor of Chateaubriand is brought out by slowly heating it at a low temperature.The chateaubriand is rolled up into a ball to give it some thickness.I think they have also studied the size of the meat and the orientation of the fibers when you put it in your mouth.The first bite is eaten with plenty of sauce, and the second bite is eaten with wasabi.This meat has a lot of flavor. It's so soft that you don't even need it. Next comes the horumon. This is Kamimino, which has a distinctive crunchy texture. This is served with refreshing lemon. At YORONIKU, you can only eat grilled horumon in the omakase course , so if you like offal, I think you should choose this course. Gopchang with a pulled texture has arrived.The unique taste of Gopchang is irresistible for offal lovers.While grilling Gopchang, we roast the silk loin.The silk loin is also an original part of YORONIKU.While pounding the silk loin, remove the excess fat and grill it.With plenty of sauce, this is a bite size. It is eaten by wrapping it with rice.The juicy fat and sauce mix well and it is very delicious.The gopchang has also started to brown a lot.The gopchang is served with grated ponzu sauce.The rich gopchang and the refreshing grated ponzu sauce go very well together.The refreshing taste of the grated ponzu sauce suppresses the fat in the hormones, making it delicious. Next , we begin preparing the main dish, the Chateaubriand rosé cutlet sandwich.The bread used is CENRE, a high-quality bread, and the staff members line up directly at the store to buy it every morning.Similar to the baguette, this one is also baked in a yakiniku roaster.The Chateaubriand rosé cutlet arrives.It's lightly battered and fried quickly. Before sandwiching it between bread, I'll just have the cutlet.It 's a very beautiful pink color😭I'll eat it with salt.Next , I'll sandwich it between toasted bread.It'll be slathered with our special sauce.The portion size for one person is half of this, but this time we had an odd number of people, so I was the only one served🙏It was super delicious! ! Next, an earthenware pot containing sukiyaki warishita was placed.The dish that came was Zabuton.This is sukiyaki, mixed with egg yolk and truffles.It 's a course that will keep you excited until the end.Thinly sliced ​​zabuton is a quick and easy meal. Cook it until it sizzles.Place it in a bowl containing egg yolk.From here, slice the seasonal truffle into generous portions.The staff will carefully mix the truffle and egg yolk to thoroughly incorporate them into the meat.It will bubble like this. First, eat only the meat and leave the eggs and truffles. Add rice to the remaining eggs and make egg-cooked rice with truffles. The beef flavor and truffle egg-cooked rice are sure to be delicious. Enjoy the meat and rice twice . I think it's a really great idea to finish the dish with Awa's hand-stretched somen.Add wasabi and seaweed to give it a refreshing flavor.Even though it's a yakiniku restaurant, it's new to use thick somen instead of cold noodles.This is chewy and delicious◎ For dessert, you can choose between two types of shaved ice, matcha or hojicha, and when you finish eating, you'll get a polar bear flavor.Since we visited on Christmas, everyone was happy to see Santa lol.It was a wonderful yakiniku that you could enjoy until the very end! Not only will you be satisfied with the quality of the meat, the originality of each menu item, the way you eat it, and the flavor, but you'll be satisfied with the customer service and charming performances.This Yakiniku restaurant is in a different genre from traditional Yakiniku restaurants.I'm sure you'll have an unforgettable experience, so if you haven't been yet, please check it out! Thank you for watching this time!",
